React Agent Executor with LangGraph
This project demonstrates the implementation of a React Agent Executor with LangGraph to perform tasks such as querying a city's temperature and processing it (e.g., multiplying it by 3). The LangGraph framework facilitates building AI agents that can interact with complex workflows efficiently.

Overview
The objective of this project is to create an intelligent agent that:

Retrieves the current temperature of a specified city.
Multiplies the temperature by 3.
Outputs the result.
This agent is powered by LangGraph and follows concepts from the research paper Language Models as Graphs: LangGraph, which outlines the creation of graph-based models for interacting with large language models (LLMs).

LangGraph provides a powerful way to structure complex interactions, improving the flexibility and performance of AI-driven applications.
